            </h3>

            <p>
                The website What is Missing? is an innovative, multi-platform memorial designed by Maya Lin to raise
                awareness about environmental loss, focusing on species extinction, habitat degradation, and climate
                change. It merges art with science through interactive data visualizations, physical installations, and
                digital experiences. The project’s centerpiece is an interactive globe that users can explore to
                understand ecological loss and potential solutions to restore biodiversity. It won multiple awards,
                including the Webby Award for Activism, for its impactful design, navigation structure, and user
                experience, blending art, technology, and environmental activism seamlessly​
